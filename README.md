## 🗂️ Module Organization

The repository is organized into distinct branches, each dedicated to a specific area of Java expertise:

| Module | Focus Area |
|--------|------------|
| **java-core** | Foundation concepts including syntax, data structures, control flow, and algorithmic thinking |
| **java-oops** | Object-oriented principles: inheritance hierarchies, polymorphic behavior, abstraction layers, and encapsulation patterns |
| **packages-in-java** | Code organization strategies using package structures and import mechanisms |
| **wrapper-class** | Boxing mechanisms, primitive-to-object conversions, and wrapper utility methods |
| **functional-interface** | Modern Java interfaces featuring functional programming, default implementations, and static interface methods |
| **error-and-exception** | Robust error handling frameworks, exception hierarchies, and custom exception design |
| **lambda-expression** | Functional programming paradigms with lambda syntax and stream operations |
