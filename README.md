## 📚 Branch Structure & Learning Modules

Each branch in this repository represents a complete learning module:

| 🌳 Branch | 📝 What I Learned |
|-----------|------------------|
| `java-core` | Core Java fundamentals - variables, operators, loops, conditionals, arrays, and string operations |
| `java-oops` | Object-oriented programming - classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and data hiding |
| `packages-in-java` | Creating and managing packages, import statements, and code organization techniques |
| `wrapper-class` | Working with wrapper classes, understanding autoboxing/unboxing, and type conversions |
| `functional-interface` | Functional interfaces, lambda expressions, default methods, and static methods in interfaces |
| `error-and-exception` | Exception handling mechanisms, try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and error management |
| `lambda-expression` | Advanced lambda usage, functional programming concepts, and practical implementations |

## 🗓️ Week-by-Week Progress Log

### 📅 **August 11-13, 2025** → Version Control Bootcamp
**🔧 Skills Acquired:**
- Installed and configured Git Bash on my local machine
- Learned the distinction between Git (version control system), Git Bash (terminal), and GitHub (hosting platform)
- Practiced essential commands: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git clone`
- Understood branching strategies and collaborative development workflows
- Wrote initial Java programs to warm up coding skills

---

### 📅 **August 18-20, 2025** → Java Foundations
**☕ Core Concepts Covered:**
- Explored the Java ecosystem and JVM architecture
- Studied primitive data types, variables, and operators
- Learned about the `main()` method and program execution lifecycle
- Practiced user input with `Scanner` class and console output formatting
- Set up my development environment with proper configurations

---

### 📅 **August 25-27, 2025** → Logic & Iteration Mastery
**🔄 Topics Explored:**
- Implemented decision-making with `if-else` statements and `switch-case` constructs
- Built loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while` for repetitive tasks
- Created and manipulated single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
- Solved problems involving nested loops and pattern printing
- Performed operations on 2D arrays including addition, multiplication, and transpose

---

### 📅 **September 1-3, 2025** → Methods & String Power
**🧩 Key Learnings:**
- Handled edge cases like null values, empty inputs, and boundary conditions
- Designed custom methods with different return types and parameters
- Understood method overloading and creating reusable code blocks
- Discovered String immutability and why strings cannot be modified
- Practiced with `StringBuffer` (thread-safe) and `StringBuilder` (faster performance)
- Analyzed performance differences between string manipulation approaches

---

### 📅 **September 8-10, 2025** → Object-Oriented Thinking
**🏗️ OOP Fundamentals:**
- Grasped the four pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- Worked with constructors: default, parameterized, and chained constructors
- Differentiated between instance variables and static class variables
- Applied access modifiers to control visibility: `public`, `private`, `protected`, default
- Created parent-child class relationships using inheritance

---

### 📅 **September 15-17, 2025** → Advanced OOP Architecture
**🎨 Design Patterns & Concepts:**
- Studied abstract classes vs interfaces and when to use each
- Implemented compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding)
- Practiced upcasting for generalization and downcasting with `instanceof` checks
- Combined abstract classes and interfaces in real scenarios
- Built mini-projects applying multiple OOP concepts together

---

### 📅 **September 22-24, 2025** → Real-World Problem Solving
**💡 Practical Application:**
- Solved industry-inspired problems using OOP principles
- Designed class hierarchies for real-world entities (banking systems, vehicle management, etc.)
- Focused on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- Emphasized code reusability and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

---

### 📅 **October 13-15, 2025** → Modern Java Features
**⚡ Functional Programming Basics:**
- Completed deep dive into Java interfaces and their implementation
- Explored functional interfaces and the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation
- Learned default methods and static methods inside interfaces
- Understood marker interfaces like `Serializable` and `Cloneable`
- Introduced to lambda expressions for writing concise code
- Practiced using lambdas with built-in functional interfaces like `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`

---

### 📅 **October 27-29, 2025** → Enterprise Java Concepts
**🔐 Professional Development Skills:**
- Organized code into packages for better project structure
- Mastered exception handling with `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`
- Distinguished between checked exceptions (compile-time) and unchecked exceptions (runtime)
- Created custom exception classes for specific error scenarios
- Worked with wrapper classes like `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean` for primitive wrapping
- Leveraged autoboxing (automatic primitive-to-wrapper) and unboxing (wrapper-to-primitive)
- Integrated all concepts into comprehensive projects combining packages, exceptions, and wrappers
